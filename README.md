# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Error with Empty or Invalid JSON

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Express.js to parse JSON request bodies. The issue arises when the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON data, causing the application to either throw an error or fail to process the request correctly.

## Bug Description
The provided Express.js code snippet attempts to parse the JSON request body using `express.json()`.  However, if the request body is empty or contains malformed JSON, it results in unexpected behavior, such as the application throwing an error or silently ignoring the request. This leads to a lack of robustness and proper error handling.

## Solution
The solution involves adding middleware to handle errors that arise from parsing the JSON request body and providing appropriate error handling responses to the client.  Additionally, input validation is crucial to ensure that the data received is in the expected format.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `node bug.js`
4. Send a POST request to `/data` with an empty body or invalid JSON data using a tool like Postman.
5. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.

## How to Fix
Follow the instructions provided in `bugSolution.js` to implement error handling and input validation to resolve the issue.
